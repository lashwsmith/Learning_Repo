Personal Projects/Learning

Currently this Repo is for my personal projects and random stuff I'm working on learning and becoming more proficient in.

novaboot.sh is a simple script which I've been working on in order to streamline the process of quickly spinning up servers for testing, as well as learning bash scripting to transfer to python in the future. Currently only tested on ubuntu.
